# Ecommerce Backend Magic

## Purpose
For this challenge I wanted to set up an application using Sequelize that would allow the client to access their inventory through the backend. I set up associations between the categories, products, and tags. I also set up routes so that the user could view, add, update, and delete their categories, products, and tags. The user simply has to type npm start into the command line to start the server, and then navigate to insomnia to test the routes and add, update, or delete as necessary. 

## Built With
*JavaScript
*Node.js
*Express.js
*MySql2
*Sequelize
